# Welcome to Folk ARPS, comrade!

Over a decade of Arma 3 and Arma 2, Folk ARPS has provided a friendly, cooperative environment for players to enjoy low-hassle Arma. No mandatory attendance, no spending 5 hours setting up arcane modlists, no out-of-game ranks or bureaucracy - just show up and have a good time.

Alongside our continuing quest to create the perfect socialist agrarian utopia, we offer regular weekly co-op sessions, playing custom-made Arma 3 missions with a welcoming community.

Sessions are held every Sunday at 19:20 UK time. We also run monthly special sessions featuring the Global Mobilization and CSLA CDLCs for Arma 3, as well as ongoing Arma 3 Antistasi campaigns.

In addition to our Arma activities, you can often find FA friends to accompany you in a variety of other games.

Interested? The Commissar is pleased to hear it! Join our [Discord server](http://www.discord.gg/0Z8wIyiaekveqtZ4) to chat with the community, have a look at the [forum](https://www.folkarps.com/forum/) for past AARs, and investigate the other pages on this site to find more details.
