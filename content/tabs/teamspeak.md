# How to communicate with us, comrade!

OK, I got the latest Teamspeak 3 from the [website](http://www.teamspeak.com/downloads), and have it installed and launched.

<v-btn block color="primary" href="ts3server://server.folkarps.com?port=9988&password=freedom"><v-icon>mdi-headset</v-icon> Connect to the Folk ARPS Teamspeak</v-btn><br/>

Alternatively use these details:

- Address: server.folkarps.com:9988 (note: the domain and port go together)
- Password: freedom

### I'm connected. Which channel should I go to?

For the session, you're going to start with "Limbo (Slotting/Dead)". When you've just arrived, hang out there. When the mission starts, everyone will move to the appropriate side channel family (BLUFOR/OPFOR/INDFOR). Further channel split will be handled by the CO. When the mission ends (either for everyone or just for you) return to limbo, and wait for the next mission.

### What about Channel Commander?

CC is a TeamSpeak feature that lets you talk to people "over the fence" of your channel. The setup we use is pretty straightforward:

- In TS3 go to Tools > Whisper Lists (Ctrl+Shift+W)
- Click on New (in the bottom-left of the dialog)
- Set a Hotkey (the suggestion is: H)
- Set Whisper to: to Groups
- Set Group Whisper Type: to Channel Commander
- Set Group Whisper Target: to Complete Channel Family
- Click OK

And you're set. To turn CC on/off, either right-click your name in the playerlist and select Channel Commander, or set-up a hotkey (or combination, such as Shift+H):

- TS3 > Settings > Options (Alt+P) > Hotkeys > Add
- In the dialogue that pops-up click on Show Advanced Options
- Under the action Channel Commander select Toggle Channel Commander
- Set a hotkey or hotkey combination (the suggestion is Shift+H)
- Click OK, then click OK again to exit the Options dialogue

## Optional TeamSpeak 3 Addons

[Cross Talk](http://addons.teamspeak.com/directory/addon/miscellaneous-plugins/CrossTalk.html) - allows you to add distortion and duck channels on TS3.
